<h1></strong>A biography of my life</strong></h1>
<p>As a child in 1930s Denmark I was like, I'm gonna be the creator a search engine called Google. I didn't know what it meant but i thought that it would change my life. It didn't, I was drafted and fought in the American Civil war about 100 years earlier. I then had to climb up Everest--and by Everest, I mean my commanding officer, Everest Livingston. He got mad then kicked me out so I had to find a new job. I decided to work as a porta potty cleaner in the year 3015. I know I should've picked a better job, maybe a more futuristic one, but I did what I could, okay? No need to be judgy. You try cleaning Robots' waste, then! The oil gets everywhere, and I was paid half a cent and a stick of used gum for it. Then I was like, well I should probably create google like a thousand years ago. So that's what I did. I'm the creator of Google. Steve Buscemi or whatever his name is. That's me. So I'm gonna need all the money in all yalls bank accounts so I can make Google better. Please, I'm so broke, please. PLEASE.</p>
